Deep in the jungle lies a goblin industrial city that guards the moon which was also a hyper mega death lazer.
The city was harboring a secret syrup factory.
The U.N. raids the city for their corn syrup and J.F.K.'s double. The city is commiting syrup fraud.
J.F.K.'s body double fends them off.
The UN also steals the moon and the factory.
Nobody committed anything else and so the fbi got away (thats bad).
